Thanks for visiting my website! I've put this together as a small way to demonstrate my abilities and to show off that: I am an accomplished Data Analyst with over 5 years of experience specializing in leveraging data to drive strategic business decision-making.

A career highlight includes serving as the founding data analyst at my last company, where I was the first member of the analytics team hired. In this role, I successfully built the entire analytics function from 0 to 1, establishing foundational data processes and tools essential for scalable, data-driven decision-making across the organization.

Core Analytical Expertise
My expertise spans the full data and Business Intelligence (BI) lifecycle:

Business Intelligence & Data Modeling: I have comprehensive experience building out the entire BI catalog for a company, ensuring data clarity and accessibility. I am proficient with a wide range of BI tools, including Tableau, Power BI, Looker, and Holistics.

Performance Metrics & Experimentation: I excel at shaping, tracking, and communicating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across company-wide goals and specific teams/products. I have hands-on experience in A/B testing (design, execution, and analysis).

Behavioral & Product Analysis: I utilize product analytics and behavioral tools like Amplitude and Google Analytics to understand user behavior and product performance.

Survey Design & Analysis: Leveraging my background in academic research, I am an expert in survey methodology, including the design, execution, and rigorous analysis of results using tools such as Google Forms and Qualtrics.

Technical & Soft Skills
Technically, I possess advanced SQL querying skills, utilizing them for both complex ad hoc requests and building efficient ETL pipelines for data modeling. I am also highly proficient in R for in-depth statistical analysis.

While my technical skills are top-notch, my true differentiator lies in my soft skills, my ability to communicate the big picture to technical and non-technical stakeholders, and my driving focus on improving organizational decision-making processes.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of human and technical systems, with a focus on both Product and People Analytics. While I acknowledge the need to specialize eventually, I enjoy working with a diverse range of data challenges today.

Beyond data, I remain an ever-curious individual dedicated to exploring and mastering new skills. On this site, you’ll find photos from my adventures traveling the world and experiencing new cultures. I pursue my passions and hobbies, including soccer, baking, and photography. There's a lot of life out there to live and I'm trying to have as much fun as I can along the way while I prove I'm more than your average Joe.
